# robot_follower

This is an implementation of a robot human-follower using Reinforcement Learning(DDPG).

Input from the environment observation is lidar points(in grid view or sequential readings).

I also created a Gazebo simulation environment with a simulated human and planar room. This needs GPU support, otherwise the simulated lidar cannot reflect on the human legs.
